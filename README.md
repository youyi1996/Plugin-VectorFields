# Plugin-VectorFields

A plugin for OpenFlipper that generates tangent vector field on a mesh.

The implementation is based on the paper [Trivial Connections on Discrete Surfaces](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/TrivialConnections/) [SGP 2010]. 

## How to build?

Clone this repository and move the whole directory (with Plugin-VectorFields) to the directory of OpenFlipper. Then rerun CMake to generate makefiles, and run `make`.
